<!--intro-start-->

Cinema project, which consists of 3 microservices interacting with each other via docker-compose

This is 3 services that serve to constantly update data from the main 
database, which is presented in the form of a post-regression to the 
database to implement the full-text search function, which in this 
project is represented by elasticsearch. For this purpose, this project 
has implemented a caroutine system that transmits data at a given period of 
time through the pipes until walking to the final goal

To get started, jump to the [installation](#installation) section or keep reading to learn more about the included
